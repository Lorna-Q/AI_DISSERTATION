### Overview
* This repository contains data and code files that form part of a graduation research project focused on text analysis of news reporting on artificial intelligence (AI) in traditional media. The project aims to explore how AI is discussed in the media over time, identifying key themes and frames in these discussions.

### Structure
##### The repository is organized into three main folders:
1. Data Folder
* Purpose: Contains the raw text of media reports from various sources, as well as processed datasets used for analysis.
* Contents:
    * Raw Texts: Downloaded media reports from different sources.
    * Merged Dataset: A single dataset combining all the raw text data.
    * Sub-datasets: Three sub-datasets split by different time periods, derived from the merged dataset.
2. Topics Folder
* Purpose: Presents the topics identified within the three sub-datasets.
* Contents:
    * Topic Modeling Results: Two sets of topics generated using topic modeling techniques applied to the sub-datasets.
    * Manually Analyzed Topics: A set of topics derived from close reading and manual analysis of the data.
3. Framing Folder
* Purpose: Focuses on analyzing the framing of AI in the media.
* Contents:
    * Framing Types: Documents that summarize different framing types, identified through manual content analysis.
    * Topic Distribution in Frames: Statistical summaries showing how different topics are distributed across various framing types.
### Usage
* The Data folder is the starting point for understanding the source materials and the structure of the datasets used in this research.
* The Topics folder provides insights into the major themes present in the media's discussion of AI, offering both automated and manually derived topic lists.
* The Framing folder delves deeper into the narratives around AI, showing how the media frames the conversation and the prevalence of different themes within those frames.

This repository serves as both a resource for those interested in media analysis and a demonstration of the research methodologies used in this study.
